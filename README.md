# BlackJack
The game of BlackJack built with WPF(Windows Presentation Foundation) and C#.

This project was made as a presentation of some of my technical skills as a software engineer to 
Robotic Vision Technologies(RVT) as part of a job application.  The project was done in a little
over a weeks time during spare time.  It was done with a simplified version of the Scrum methodology
where aspects were removed based on whether or not they'd be applicable to a project being done
by a single person rather than a team.

Running this program should only be a matter of importing it into Visual Studio and building it from
there.  A more thorough explanation can be found via these links:
